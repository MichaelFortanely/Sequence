Here's the Wikipedia page for this game https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_(game)#Objective. In this version there are only two players, you and the computer. The players take turns until one of the players gets 5 chips in a row.  Here's a short explanation from this game's wikipedia page explaining how the typical turn works: 

"On their turn, the player chooses a card from their hand to play, then places a marker chip on one of the corresponding spaces of the game board (Example: An Ace of Diamonds is played from a player's hand; that player places a chip on the Ace of Diamonds on the board)."


Instead of having one-eyed and two-eyed Jacks, one-eyed jacks abilities are transferred to the red jacks and likewise for two-eyed jacks with black jacks in this version. So the jack of hearts and jack of diamonds can remove chips and the jack of clubs and jack of spades can be used to place a chip in any free space. The black chips in the corners on top of jokers contribute towards sequences for both players and cannot be displaced. The 'replace card' button is for when you can't play a specific card in your hand. However this will count as a turn. Simply refresh the page to play a new game!
