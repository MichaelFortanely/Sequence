Here's the Wikipedia page for this game https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_(game)#Objective.

In this version there are only two players, you and the computer. The first player to get a sequence wins. Instead of having one-eyed and two-eyed jacks, one-eyed jacks abilities are transferred to the red jacks and likewise for two-eyed jacks with black jacks. So the jack of hearts and jack of diamonds can remove chips and the jack of clubs and jack of spades can be used to place a chip in any free space.
